# See Me Drive
See Me Drive is a 2D mobile driving game available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.kalelx.seemedrive).

The game was developed for the course [Design and Programming of Computer Games](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD23/) given at Link√∂ping University.

My goal with See Me Drive was to create a game which was enjoyable for everyone regardless of previous experience and physical abilities.
